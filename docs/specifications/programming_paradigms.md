# Programming Paradigms

## Structured Programming

### General Description
The structured programming implemented in this project follows the fundamental principles of sequence, selection, and iteration. This paradigm is primarily used for operations that require linear control flow and direct data manipulation.

### Implemented Features
- **Control Structures**: Use of if-else, switch, while, for
- **Modular Functions**: Well-defined procedures and functions
- **Local and Global Variables**: Efficient variable scope management
- **Arrays and Matrices**: Implementation of basic data structures

### Use Cases
- Sequential data processing
- Mathematical algorithms
- Array manipulation
- Basic input/output operations

## Modular Programming

### General Description
Modular programming in this project focuses on creating independent and reusable components, each with a specific and well-defined responsibility.

### Implemented Features
- **Independent Modules**: Autonomous components with specific functionality
- **Defined Interfaces**: Clear APIs for inter-module communication
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding implementation details
- **Code Reuse**: Modules designed to be used in different contexts

### Module Structure
- **Utilities Module**: Reusable common functions
- **Validation Module**: Data verification and business rules
- **Persistence Module**: Data storage management
- **Interface Module**: User interaction handling

## Object-Oriented Programming

### General Description
Object-oriented programming implements a complete system based on objects that interact with each other, using the fundamental principles of OOP.

### Implemented Principles

#### 1. Encapsulation
- Private attributes with access methods
- Well-defined public interfaces
- Internal data protection

#### 2. Inheritance
- Logical class hierarchies
- Code reuse through inheritance
- Implementation of abstract classes

#### 3. Polymorphism
- Method overloading
- Method overriding
- Interfaces and abstract types

#### 4. Abstraction
- Real-world concept modeling
- Abstract interfaces
- Separation of concerns

### Design Patterns Used
- **Singleton**: For unique instances
- **Factory**: Flexible object creation
- **Observer**: For event handling
- **Strategy**: For interchangeable algorithms

## Paradigm Integration

### Combination Strategy
The project demonstrates how different paradigms can coexist and complement each other:

1. **Base Level**: Structured programming for fundamental operations
2. **Middle Level**: Modules for specific functionalities
3. **Upper Level**: Objects for domain modeling and business logic

### Integration Benefits
- Greater design flexibility
- Better code maintainability
- Effective component reuse
- Improved scalability
